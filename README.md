3ain Project
This project is a road pothole detecter called 3ain, which detect road potholes and classify thier severity
3ain model is a cpombined model that uses YOLOv7 and squental CNN, to detect then classify. Alt text

Files contained in the project:
Train.ipynb
Open-source python code for 3ain model training, the code is self-explaining.

Detect.ipynb
Open-source python code to use 3ain model, you can use the pretrained model named "best.pt", or train your model and use it, the code is also self-explaining.

dataset
The dataset file which is used for YOLOv7 model(just an example).

dataset2
The dataset file which is used for the CNN model(just an example).
